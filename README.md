To run:
- Change host URL and port in wgsi.py
- Run wgsi.py
- Add mp3 files into the track folder (or can be changed in music.py) (The format of filename each file should be "artist" - "title".mp3)

The artist, title, and current timestamp of the current track should be updated automatically.
You can control the tracks via the interface.
